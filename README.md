# EV3_CLEVER_LIBRARY
Library for CLEVER for Lego EV3 brick with simple motions like go forward, backward, turn left/right with one/two motors

## Problem
CLEVER and competition participants usually don't share libraries because it will help opponents. Though, a lot of teams use SPIKE, still some teams use EV3 block. With this library, it will be much easier to solve some problems.
